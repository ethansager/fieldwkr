# fieldwkr

R port of selected iefieldkit workflows for primary data collection.

## Installation

```r
# devtools::install_github("<your-org>/fieldwkr")
```

## Usage

```r
library(fieldwkr)

# Example: export and apply a codebook
cb_path <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")
iecodebook_export(mtcars, cb_path)
updated <- iecodebook_apply(mtcars, cb_path)
```

## Notes

- Requires the `openxlsx` package; `haven` is optional for labelled data.
- This package mirrors the Stata workflows at a practical level but does not
  implement every validation rule in the original commands.
